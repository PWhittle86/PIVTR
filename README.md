# Shares App

More and more people are playing the stock market. A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a minimum viable product (MVP) that uses the data to display her portfolio in useful ways so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP

View total current value of the portfolio
View information for individual shares held
Ability to 'buy'/add more stocks to the portfolio and 'sell'/remove them and update total value.
View performance trends for individual stocks and the portfolio as a whole
